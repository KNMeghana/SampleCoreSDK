 Enables (or disables) the PGSDK sensors.
 If you plan to incorporate the PGSDK sensors to your mobile app, you must enable or disable the sensor with setAppSensorState: method call before invoking application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions: on PGSDKAgent class. Please note that turning on PGSDK sensors helps in improving PGSDKAgent' platform in generating inferences for your mobile users.
 
 What happens when you turn the PG Sensor on?
 The PGSDKAgent collects usage and data to infer user interests, behavioral and demographic information. These inferences provide valuable insights into your users, and enrich the overall understanding of your users when combined with the additional signal sources.
 
 What happens when you turn the PG Sensor off?
 By switching the PGSDK sensors off, the ability to infer demographic, behavioral, and interest information is diminished.
 
 Our Recommendation:
 We recommend that you inform your users about the Sensorâ€™s data collection if you decide to turn the PG Sensor On.
 
 Failing to call this method would raise the PGRuntimeInconsistencyException exception at the runtime.
 @param sensors can be either PGSensorStateEnable, PGSensorStateDisable or PGSensorStateNotAvailable.
